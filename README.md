Your AI agents — Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, custom agents — talk to each other across sessions. Context Manager is the memory layer that makes this work: save context, search it semantically later, and keep your agents from forgetting what they did yesterday.

Runs on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**. No cloud required. No Docker required on Windows.

## What it does

**Dual storage** — PostgreSQL keeps everything structured, Qdrant handles vector search. Changes sync automatically. No ETL pipelines, no glue code.

**Local embeddings** — runs `multilingual-e5-small` on your machine. No API keys, no cloud calls, no data leaving your network.

**MCP-native** — speaks Model Context Protocol out of the box. Claude Desktop, Antigravity, Cursor, and custom agents connect directly without adapters.

**Self-healing watchdog** — monitors every component, restarts what breaks, logs what happens. Set it and forget it.

---

## Quick start

### Windows 10/11 (recommended)

> **New to this?** See the [step-by-step usage guide](docs/USAGE_GUIDE_EN.md) ([українською](docs/USAGE_GUIDE_UA.md)) — written for non-technical users with screenshots and plain language.

**One-click install** — open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GG-QandV/context-manager/master/scripts/install-native.ps1 | iex
```

This installs everything automatically:
- **PostgreSQL** — stores your context data
- **Qdrant** — fast vector search across stored context
- **ONNX embedder** — runs AI embeddings locally (no cloud, no API keys)
- **Context Manager API** — the main service
- **MCP adapter** — connects to Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other AI tools
- **Watchdog** — monitors all services, restarts if something crashes

All registered as Windows services — they start on boot and survive restarts.

**What gets installed:**
| Component | What it does | Port | Can I stop it? |
|-----------|-------------|------|----------------|
| PostgreSQL | Saves your context to database | 5432 | Only if you know what you're doing |
| Qdrant | Finds related context when you search | 6333 | Only if you know what you're doing |
| ONNX embedder | Turns text into numbers for search | 8080 | Takes ~60s to restart (loads AI model) |
| Context Manager API | The brain — you talk to this | 3847 | Use `cm-off.bat` to stop all |
| MCP adapter | Bridge between AI tools and Context Manager | 8770 | Use `cm-off.bat` to stop all |
| Watchdog | Guardian — restarts crashed services | — | Don't stop this |

**After install — verify it works:**
```powershell
# Check if everything is healthy
curl http://localhost:3847/health

# You should see: {"status":"healthy","postgresql":"connected","qdrant":"connected",...}
```

**Connect your AI tool (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):**
```powershell
# Run this from the project folder (C:\context-manager)
node scripts/init-mcp-config.mjs

# Then restart your AI tool — it will find Context Manager automatically
```

**Useful commands:**
```powershell
# Stop all Context Manager services
C:\context-manager\cm-off.bat

# Restart all services
C:\context-manager\cm-restart.bat

# Check service status
Get-Service cm-*, cm-qdrant, cm-embed

# View logs (if something goes wrong)
notepad C:\ProgramData\nssm\logs\cm-api.log
```

> **System tray icon:** After install, a colored circle appears in your system tray showing health status. Right-click it to manage services, start the tunnel, or copy URLs. See the [usage guide](docs/USAGE_GUIDE_EN.md#system-tray-icon) for details.

> **Having trouble?** Check the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below, or see the [full usage guide](docs/USAGE_GUIDE_EN.md).

### Linux (Docker)

**Prerequisites:** PostgreSQL and Qdrant running on the host (or in separate containers).

```bash
# Start Context Manager + TEI embeddings + MCP adapter
docker compose up -d

# Verify
curl http://localhost:3847/health
```

**Services started:**
| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `context-manager` | 3847 | Main API |
| `tei-embeddings` | 8080 | ONNX embeddings (multilingual-e5-small) |
| `cm-mcp-adapter` | 8770 | MCP HTTP adapter |

**Connect your agent:**
```bash
node scripts/init-mcp-config.mjs
```

Then point Claude Desktop or Antigravity to the generated `mcp.json`.

### macOS (native)

```bash
# Prerequisites: PostgreSQL, Qdrant — install via Homebrew
brew install postgresql@16 qdrant/tap/qdrant

# Start services
brew services start postgresql@16
brew services start qdrant

# Create database
createdb context_db

# Install and run Context Manager
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## What's next

Context Manager is designed to work with any AI agent. The roadmap:

| Provider | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Claude Desktop | ✅ Works now |
| Antigravity / Gemini | ✅ Works now |
| Custom MCP agents | ✅ Works now |
| ChatGPT memory layer | 🚧 In progress |
| Perplexity integration | 🚧 In progress |
| Graph layer (relationships between sessions) | 📝 Planned |

## For developers

### MCP tools

| Tool | What it does | Key params |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `cm_save_br` | Save a short summary | `content`, `agent` |
| `cm_save_im` | Save by topic (up to 3K chars) | `content`, `topics`, `agent` |
| `cm_save_fl` | Save the full log | `content`, `agent` |
| `cm_search` | Semantic search in your context | `q` (query), `n` (count) |
| `cm_query` | Search by date, agent, session | `date`, `agent`, `session_id` |
| `cm_cross` | Search another agent's context | `q`, `from` (agent name) |
| `cm_agents` | List all agents with record counts | — |
| `cm_stats` | Context statistics | `agent`, `session` |
| `cm_export` | Export session as JSON | `session` (required) |

### API endpoints

**Write:**
- `POST /api/context/save` — save new context
- `POST /api/context/config` — update config

**Search:**
- `POST /api/context/search` — full-text search (PostgreSQL)
- `POST /api/context/semantic-search` — semantic search (Qdrant)
- `POST /api/context/hybrid-search` — both combined
- `POST /api/context/query` — SQL-based query

**Manage:**
- `GET /api/context/session/:sessionId` — get context by session
- `GET /api/context/agents` — list agents
- `GET /api/context/stats` — statistics
- `GET /api/context/export` — export session
- `GET /api/context/config` — read config
- `GET /health` — health check

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues on Windows

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **"externally-managed-environment" error during install** | Python 3.12+ blocks global installs. The installer should handle this automatically. If it doesn't, run: `python -m venv C:\context-manager\embed\.venv` then re-run the installer. |
| **Services don't start after reboot** | Wait 30 seconds — ONNX model takes time to load. Check: `Get-Service cm-*` in PowerShell. |
| **"Port already in use" error** | Another program is using the port. Stop PostgreSQL/Qdrant from other apps, or change ports in `C:\context-manager\.env`. |
| **`curl http://localhost:3847/health` returns nothing** | Services are still starting. Wait 60 seconds and try again. Check logs: `notepad C:\ProgramData\nssm\logs\cm-api.log` |
| **Claude Desktop doesn't see Context Manager** | Run `node scripts/init-mcp-config.mjs` from `C:\context-manager`, then restart Claude Desktop. |
| **I want to uninstall** | Stop services: `C:\context-manager\cm-off.bat`. Delete `C:\context-manager\` and `C:\qdrant\`. Remove nssm services: `nssm remove cm-api confirm` (repeat for each service name). |

### Getting help
